        “Memory Lane explores the childhood memories of Félix Luque and Iñigo Bilbao in Asturias (Spain). Using 3D
        scanning techniques, they digitalize a series of Landscapes: dead forests, beaches and rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Working in real locations that have a profound meaning for them, the artists elaborate a fiction using
        consciously implausible elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        The result is an extremely detailed reproduction of these places, but at the same time a ghostly, distant and
        incomplete representation, that gradually becomes a fiction. Together with Damien Gernay, the three artists
        elaborate a particular imitation of nature, which is captured with the most accurate precision allowed by
        current technology, and at the same time transform it into something consciously artificial.
    </p>
    <p>
        By converting nature into data, the artists create a sculptural representation with its own physicality. Using
        3D modelling software, CNC milling machines,mechatronics and electronic custom systems, they are able to create
        a completely different reality.
    </p>
    <p>
        The result is a parallel existence, with its own behaviors and language, which no longer belong to the humans
        who imagined them, but to the machines that shaped them.”
