“Memory Lane explores the childhood memories of Félix Luque and Iñigo Bilbao in Asturias (Spain). Using 3D scanning
techniques, they digitalize a series of Landscapes: dead forests, beaches and rocks.

Working in real locations that have a profound meaning for them, the artists elaborate a fiction using consciously
implausible elements.

The result is an extremely detailed reproduction of these places, but at the same time a ghostly, distant and incomplete
representation, that gradually becomes a fiction. Together with Damien Gernay, the three artists elaborate a particular
imitation of nature, which is captured with the most accurate precision allowed by current technology, and at the same
time transform it into something consciously artificial.

By converting nature into data, the artists create a sculptural representation with its own physicality. Using 3D
modelling software, CNC milling machines,mechatronics and electronic custom systems, they are able to create a
completely different reality.

The result is a parallel existence, with its own behaviors and language, which no longer belong to the humans who
imagined them, but to the machines that shaped them.”
