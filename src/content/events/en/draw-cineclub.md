How could an artist discover abstraction in the early 20th century without anyone noticing? A woman, misunderstood and
hidden away, shook the art world with her breathtaking work. Hilma af Klint was a pioneer, creating her first abstract
painting in 1906, four years before Wassily Kandinsky. But why was she ignored? Why are her paintings not available on
the market? This film is about her life and work, the role of women in art history, and the discovery of an artistic
scandal.

Af Klint did not see herself as the sole creator of her works, but followed a system of complex symbolic rules, much
like a generative artist who creates the algorithms that feed his machine. By collaborating with this “external force”
to paint an invisible world, she adopted the stance of an artist in dialogue with a system, making her an astonishing
precursor of generative art.
