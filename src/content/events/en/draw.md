**From January 13 to 30, discover the DRAW() group show at Overflow!**

In the 50s and 60s, the first computational artists used drawing machines — or pen plotters — to visualize works that the
computers of the time could not yet render on screen.

60 years later, advancements in computing and the democratization of printing have made these slow and impractical
machines obsolete. But they have found a new life in the hands of digital artists who see them as a way to make their
work, often confined to screens, more tangible, more moving, more human.

## Practical Info

* From 13 to 30 January 2026
* Visits: Tuesday to Saturday between 1pm and 6pm
* Free admission
* Opening: Saturday, January 10 at 6:30pm
* Address: Rue Hongrée 6B, 4000 Liège

## Group Exhibition

Through the works of 7 Belgian and international artists, the exhibition invites you to discover the practice of
generative art (where the work is generated by a semi-autonomous system created by the artist) and pen plotting in
all its diversity, both in terms of aesthetics and technique.
