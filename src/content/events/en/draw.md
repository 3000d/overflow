**From January 13 to 30, discover the DRAW() group show at Overflow!**

In the 50s and 60s, the first computational artists used drawing machines — or pen plotters — to visualize works that
the
computers of the time could not yet render on screen.

60 years later, advancements in computing and the democratization of printing have made these slow and impractical
machines obsolete. But they have found a new life in the hands of digital artists who see them as a way to make their
work, often confined to screens, more tangible, more moving, more human.

## Practical Info

* From 13 to 30 January 2026
* Visits: Tuesday to Saturday between 1pm and 6pm
* Free admission
* Opening: Saturday, January 10 at 6:30pm
* Address: Rue Hongrée 6B, 4000 Liège

## Group Exhibition

Through the works of 7 Belgian and international artists, the exhibition invites you to discover the practice of
generative art (where the work is generated by a semi-autonomous system created by the artist) and pen plotting in
all its diversity, both in terms of aesthetics and technique.

Curation: Jonathan Berger / Overflow \
_With the support of [Vetro Editions](https://vetroeditions.com/) and the Department of Culture of the City of Liège._

### Arno Beck

Arno Beck’s prints and conceptual paintings evolve around digital aesthetics and focus on analog production of digital
images. Engaging with the language of digital culture the motifs are based on low resolution computer graphics, games
and interfaces. It is an interplay between the contemporary digital screen world and traditional techniques.

### Jessica In

As an Architect, Designer and Coder, Jessica’s work places a particular emphasis on the expressive potential of
computation as a means to explore bespoke design. Notions of code, drawing, algorithmic beauty and geometry to explore
immaterial and spatial relationships are the core of her work. Currently focusing on architectural representation and
machine learning, she is a PhD candidate at the Bartlett School of Architecture where she is also a Lecturer and
Co-Programme Director of its MArch Design for Performance and Interaction programme.

### Julien Gachadoat (v3ga)

Julien Gachadoat (aka v3ga) has been exploring generative drawing for many years. He grew up in the 90s amid the
avant-garde demo scene, making visuals with code. Ever since, programming languages have been his creative tool.

Creating unique art with algorithms, he works with the emergence of abstract form. Combining monochrome, geometric
shapes, he plays with repetition, using random operations to generate an element of surprise. Julien Gachadoat uses the
computer - "this unique performer" (Vera Molnár) - to develop his own creative tools based on simple graphic rules, and
then to explore the formal possibilities that ensue. By printing these unique pieces with a plotter, he creates a link
between text and code, between computer and pencil, and between the rigour of code and the poetry of art. "To leave a
unique mark, aesthetically palpable, that is not in defiance, but rather in aid of the digital": this is his philosophy.
