In 2015, inspired by [Zach Lieberman](http://zach.li/) _school for poetic computation_, we started the first sessions
of the **Poetic Computation Club**, a space for discussion and exchange around hacking and media art.

10 years later we start again!

For this first session we'll have two speakers:

- [Ramiro Polla](https://ffglitch.org/who/) will present [ascii.jpeg](http://jpeg.ffglitch.org/ascii/), a tool that
  generates
  JPEG files with ASCII text
- We will discuss AI slop and how it is eating the world with [Jonathan Berger](https://www.instagram.com/drskullster/).

⚠️ The format is still experimental, expect a casual and somewhat messy format. Register

Note: if you have a topic you'd like to discuss, a project you'd like to show, or if you'd like to get involved in these meetups
in any way please reach out!
