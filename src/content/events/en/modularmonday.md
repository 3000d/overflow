**Modular Mondays** is a new monthly meeting at Overflow to meet with fellow synth heads, modular enthousiasths, and
other sound hackers.

It's open by design, we'll start with a _show-and-tell_ (10' max per participant) to talk about anything you want: a
patch, a module, a synth, a project, an idea,... Physical or virtual, finished or unfinhed, yours or someone else,... (
even if it's not *modular*, it's also cool).

Then we'll gather around the bar for discussions, knob twiddling, and cable plugging.

If you want to buy, sell, give, or exchange stuffs, that's cool as well.

**Note:** There will be tables and a few headphone splitters; please avoid speakers if possible. Bring your own
headphones, we won't have enough for everyone.

Come as you are.

P.S.: It's a free event
