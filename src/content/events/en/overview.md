From March 15 to April 5, OVERFLOW windows become a visual studio oriented towards the public space.

Inspired by community radios lik The Lot Radio (NY) or Kiosk (BXL), this project brings the idea to the visual domain,
creating a unique connection between urban space and digital art.

The public will be able tto interact with the artists works through numerous interactive devices, creating a collective
artistic experience.

The performances will be accompanied by a musical curation from [LEA ASBL](http://www.leaasbl.be/).
