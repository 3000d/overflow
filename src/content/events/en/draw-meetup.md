We'll meet up in the afternoon with several pen plotters available. If you want to learn how to use them, or if you're
just curious to see the machines in action, this is the perfect time to try them out and understand how they work.
For regulars, there will be a "plot" challenge based on a theme that will be revealed on the day.

In the evening, we'll make way for two or three artists who will come and present their work, and then we can
continue chatting over a drink.

And it's free!
